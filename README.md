## My plan: TODO
- [ ] **Embeddings:** Train Word2Vec model to generate vector representations.
    - [ ] my own custom made
        - [ ] Build vocab
        - [ ] Train a model
    - [*] A normal one


- [ ] **Most of my code will be Word2vec that i will rebuild to Doc2vec**

--- 

- [ ] **Vector Store:** Integrate a vector store library or database, such as FAISS - mabye do from scratch.
    - [ ] my own custom made
    - [ ] A common solution

- [ ] **Indexing:** Use FAISS's indexing capabilities to enable fast similarity search and experiment with building a custom index.
    - [ ] my own custom made
    - [ ] a common one like FAISS Index

- [ ] **Data Mapping:** Maintain a mapping between original data and their corresponding vectors to interpret search results accurately.

- [ ] **Query/Similarity Function:** Implement a search function to query the vector store and retrieve the most similar vectors to a given input.
    - [ ] my own custom made
    - [ ] a common one like FAISS Search

### FAISS

**FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is an open-source library by Meta (Facebook) for **efficient similarity search** and clustering of high-dimensional vectors.

#### What does it do?

* Lets you **store and search millions (or billions) of vectors** fast.
* Used for **nearest neighbor search**â€”finding the most similar vectors (e.g., which documents, images, or words are closest to a query).

#### Why use it?

* Regular brute-force search is slow when you have a lot of data.
* FAISS is **optimized for speed and scale**. It uses smart algorithms and (optionally) your GPU.

#### How does it work (in a nutshell)?

* You give it a big list of vectors (from Word2Vec, BERT, etc.).
* It indexes them for **fast lookup**.
* You query with a new vector, and FAISS quickly finds the closest vectors (most similar items).
